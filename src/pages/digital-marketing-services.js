                          <strong>Review Their Portfolio:</strong> Examine the
                          {"agency’s"} past work to see if {"they’ve"} achieved
                          results for businesses similar to yours. A strong
                          portfolio speaks volumes about their capabilities.

                          <strong>Assess Their Transparency:</strong> A good
                          agency will be upfront about its strategies,
                          timelines, and pricing. Be wary of those offering
                          vague promises or {'"guaranteed"'} results.
